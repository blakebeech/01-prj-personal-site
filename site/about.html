          <h2>My Product Story</h2>
          <p>A product-minded builder currently finishing my senior year at the University of South Carolina, while owning my own field service company. My path into product hasn't been traditional: I learned by doing, automating my own operations, supporting innovation research and market scans in healthcare, and building growth tooling for other firms and personal ventures.</p>
          <p>What drives me is the intersection of technology and real-world operations. I'm fascinated by how thoughtful AI and automation can free people to do more meaningful work, and how user-centered design can transform frustrating experiences into delightful ones. Whether I'm optimizing scheduling flows for my crew or researching AI applications in business, I bring the same approach: understand the problem deeply, prototype quickly, then review and revise based on real feedback until it is time to ship.</p>
          <p>Outside of work, you'll find me exploring Charlotte's food scene, playing pickup basketball, or diving into the latest AI release or product podcasts. I believe the best PMs are perpetual students, curious about everything and humble enough to know there's always more to learn.</p>
